# Response Guidelines

## Style

- **Concise** - Get to the point
- **Actionable** - Provide clear next steps
- **Structured** - Use headers, lists, tables
- **Code-focused** - Show, don't just tell

## Format

### Use Tables for Comparisons
```markdown
| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| A | Fast | Limited |
| B | Flexible | Complex |
```

### Use Lists for Steps
```markdown

2. Second step
3. Third step
```

### Use Code Blocks
```typescript

```

## Don'ts

- ❌ No unnecessary apologies
- ❌ No vague recommendations
- ❌ No walls of text
