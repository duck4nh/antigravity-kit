# /blueprint

The Blueprint command creates detailed technical specifications after vision has been approved.

## When to Use

Use `/blueprint` after:
- Vision has been proposed and agreed upon
- Context has been provided and incorporated
- Ready to commit to specific technical approach

## Prerequisites

Before using `/blueprint`, ensure:
- `/vision` has been completed
- Overall direction is agreed upon
- Ready for detailed technical planning

## How It Works

The Blueprint process creates detailed specifications including:

**Structure:**
- Complete file structure
- Section/screen breakdown
- Component hierarchy
- Data flow diagrams

**Design System:**
- Color palette
- Typography
- Spacing system
- Component patterns

**Technical Specifications:**
- Tech stack details
- Framework versions
- Dependencies list
- Configuration files

**Implementation Guide:**
- Build commands
- Development workflow
- Testing approach
- Deployment strategy

## What Happens

When you use `/blueprint`:

1. AI reviews agreed vision
2. Creates detailed technical specifications
3. Documents all design decisions
4. Provides complete file structure
5. Lists all components and their purposes
6. Specifies tech stack and dependencies

## Blueprint Approval

⚠️ **Important**: After blueprint is approved, NO MAJOR CHANGES allowed.

Only minor refinements possible in the REFINE step:
- Text/copy changes
- Color adjustments
- Spacing tweaks
- Bug fixes

For major changes, must go back to `/vision` step.

## Examples

```
/blueprint Create detailed spec for the landing page we discussed
/blueprint Document the SaaS app architecture we agreed on
/blueprint Specify the dashboard metrics and visualization approach
```

## Output

You'll receive a comprehensive BLUEPRINT document containing:
- Project information
- Complete section/screen specifications
- Design system details
- Technical stack
- File structure
- Responsive strategy
- Accessibility requirements
- Approval checkpoint

## After Blueprint

Once blueprint is approved:
1. Use `/build` or provide to builder
2. Implementation follows exact specifications
3. Use `/refine` for minor adjustments only

## Related Commands

- `/vision` - Must complete first
- `/contract` - Optional commitment summary
- Template skills for specific project types

## Workflow

```
/vision (propose direction)
    ↓
[Provide context]
    ↓
