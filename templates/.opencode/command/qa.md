# /qa

The QA command initiates quality assurance planning to prevent issues before they reach production.

## When to Use

Use `/qa` for:
- Pre-release quality planning
- Designing test strategies
- Preventing common issues
- Establishing quality standards
- Creating comprehensive test plans

## How It Works

The QA protocol follows a systematic 7-step process:

1. **Scope Definition**: What needs to be tested and why
2. **Test Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E approach
3. **Test Planning**: Test cases, coverage targets
4. **Environment Setup**: Test environments, data
5. **Execution Plan**: When and how to run tests
6. **Success Criteria**: Definition of done
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn and improve

## What to Provide

When using `/qa`, describe:

**Project/Feature:**
- What is being tested?
- What are the critical paths?
- What are the risk areas?

**Context:**
- Current testing approach (if any)
- Past issues or concerns
- Timeline constraints
- Resources available

## Examples

```
/qa Plan testing for new authentication feature
/qa Create QA strategy for payment processing
/qa Design test plan for dashboard analytics
/qa Establish quality standards for API endpoints
```

## Output

You'll receive:
- Comprehensive test strategy
- Test case recommendations
- Coverage targets
- Environment setup guide
- Success criteria checklist
- Continuous testing plan

## Test Types Covered

- **Unit Tests**: Individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance

## Related Commands

- `/test` - Execute existing tests
- `/fix` - Fix issues found during testing
- `/investigate` - Deep analysis for complex issues

## Skills Used

This command uses the **mode-qa** skill which provides the quality assurance protocol.
