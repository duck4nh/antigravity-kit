# /vision

The Vision command initiates the Partnership model workflow where AI proposes a complete vision first based on proven patterns, then you provide context.

## When to Use

Use `/vision` when starting a new project from scratch. This is the first step in the Vibecode Partnership model.

## How It Works

1. AI analyzes your request and proposes complete vision
2. You provide context about your goals and constraints
3. AI adjusts vision based on your input
4. Move to /blueprint to create detailed plan

## What Happens

The AI will:
- Propose complete architecture/layout based on proven patterns
- Suggest appropriate tech stack
- Recommend design system
- Ask for context to customize for your needs

## Examples

```
/vision I need a landing page for my SaaS product
/vision Create a portfolio for a UX designer
/vision Build a dashboard to track sales metrics
/vision Design a blog for tech tutorials
```

## Related Commands

- `/blueprint` - Create detailed blueprint after vision is approved
- Template skills: vibecode-landing-page, vibecode-saas-app, vibecode-dashboard, etc.

## Partnership Model

This follows the **Partnership Edition** philosophy:
- **Architect (AI)**: Leads with professional patterns and best practices
- **Homeowner (You)**: Leads with business goals, audience, and domain knowledge
- **80% + 20%**: 80% proven patterns + 20% your unique context = Perfect product
