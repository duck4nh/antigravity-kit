# Codex Template Bundle (Vibecode + .opencode)

This folder is a copy-ready Codex template:

```text
.codex/
  config.toml
  skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

For newest Codex discovery behavior, mirror the same skills under:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Both structures are provided in `templates/` for compatibility.
